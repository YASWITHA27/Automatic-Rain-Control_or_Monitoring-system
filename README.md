# Automatic-Rain-Control_or_Monitoring-system
As we know that water is a very valuable natural resource and therefore needs to be conserved in all the ways possible. The Rain Alarm Sensor is a simple but very useful project whose main aim is to detect rain water when it falls on the device and automatically trigger a buzzer. Rain water sensor is the main component of this project which is a vero board. The principle or the driving factor for this project is that “ water acts as a conducting path between the wires of the vero board and hence completes the circuit which causes the buzzer to buzz”
